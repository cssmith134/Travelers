# Travelers

## Description
This is a web-based app built for users planning travels within the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. The app provides a 5-day weather forecast and COVID-19 data in a city and state of the user's choice. COVID-19 data consist of new COVID-19 cases and deaths and COVID-19 risk levels. Risk levels are graded on a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being low risk and 5 being extremely high risk. 

## User Story
```
AS A USER looking for a city to travel to, 
I WOULD LIKE an application that allows me to see information about potential destinations' weather and COVID-19 situation
WHEN I am on the homepage
THEN I am presented with options for City Weather and COVID-19 Info on the top right-hand of the screen
WHEN I click City Weather
THEN I am directed to input a city name to get current and future weather for the city of my choice
WHEN I enter new city name
THEN the previous search is saved and displayed at the bottom of the City Weather section
WHEN I click COVID-19 Info at the top right-hand of the screen
THEN I am presented with a drop-down menu of states in the United States
WHEN I select a state from the drop-down menu
THEN I am presented with the new COVID-19 cases, death, and risk level for that state  
```
